// Acc Pattern

// Iterative Native Array Methods

// For each of the following exercises, 
// 1. write them using a for loop first
// 2. comment out the accumulator pattern solution and write it using a native array method
// 3. call the function and console.log the result

// 1. Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns a new array where each string is replaced by it's length
// ["hello", "world"] => [5, 5] 

// 2. Write a function that takes an array of strings and returns an array of strings longer than 5 characters (spaces count)

// 3. Write a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a new array of the lengths of strings longer than 5 characters

// 4. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numebrs

// 5. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the min num

// 6. Write a function that takes in a string and returns the character that appears the most times (only letters count)
